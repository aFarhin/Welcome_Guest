# Welcome_Guest

Here I have created just a simple Welcome Guest fun app. where I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Javascript logic :
1.  Array to store numbers which will allow guests to enter 
2. 2 different Functions for name and number buttons
3. boolean operator to disable and enable a button
4. comparison operators to check conditions
5. if- else condition to check values if entered data
6. DOM to manipulate HTML
